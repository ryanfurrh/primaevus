Today marks a day that has and will always live in deplomacy. A breaking of ground in the frontier to the beginning of conciousness.

Primaevus is derived from *prÄ«mus* meaning "first, and *aevum* meaning "age". This is the dawn of the first age. 

I want to pull down the curtain at the start, and say I am just a humble vessle, a modest dimensional gateway into the realm beyond.
