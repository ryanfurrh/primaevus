Today marks the dawn of the first age. A new frontier into the beginning of consciousness.

The **Prīmaevus** is the fundamental structure in all living beings (_prīmus_ meaning "first", and _aevum_ meaning "age"). In our research, we have uncovered the key condition for consciousness and life itself—**Flux**. The divine spark. Flux is the dynamistic source energy which flows through the _Animus_, or soul of every being— from the smallest single-cell Nanoarchaeum, to the complexities of our own consciousness.

I would like to pull down the veil at the beginning, and say I am just a humble vessel, a modest metaphysical gateway into the origins of consciousness. The work we’re doing is not for fame or glory, but to build this connection, for a true unity and understanding of the world that lies beyond.

More to come.
